**Date**: August 16, 2025

-------

### üéØ Objective

- Rename the Windows Server to a recognizable hostname.
- Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and promote the server to a Domain Controller.

-------

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

#### 1. Renamed the Server:
- Changed computer name to `Server2016` for more readability
- Restarted server to apply the name change

#### 2. Installed Active Directory Domain Services:

- Opened Server Manager
- Clicked "Add roles and features"
- Selected Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Completed installation

 #### 3. Promoted Server to a Domain

 - After AD DS was installed, clicked "Promote this server to a domain controller" 
 - Selected "Add a new forest"
 - Domain name: KirtlandGrissom.com
 - Set DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password
 - Restarted server after promotion

### üß† What I Learned

 - Renaming the server before AD setup prevents replication or identity issues.
 - Domain Controllers must have static IPs and DNS set to themselves.
 - AD setup adds DNS and other necessary services.
